                This was a 2 week project in which I was prompted to design a video prototype of a new and unique dating app. After
                conducting research from many dating apps on the app store, I noticed that many people had pets in their profiles.
                With this knowledge I decided to create a dating app for people with pets so they could meet each other without the
                anxiety of going to a date alone. I made this prototype with Photoshop and edited the video in Premiere Pro.

            <p class="bold">How can we facilitate connections for individuals who are single and experience anxiety when meeting new people face-to-face?</p>
            <p>
                During and after the pandemic many people faced difficulties finding partners and many were scared of meeting people new people face to face. The prolonged periods of isolation and social distancing measures further exacerbated feelings of loneliness, making it even more daunting for those with anxiety to navigate the dating scene. As society resumed social interactions, there is a pressing need to provide support and resources tailored to the unique needs of individuals dealing with both the complexities of dating and the anxiety of in-person encounters.

        <h2>Goal</h2>

        <div class="overview-text">
            <p>
               My goal was to design an app prototype of a unique and exciting dating app to encourage and welcome single people that 
               are typically more anxious and nervous when it comes to meeting new people. In order to do this I had to conduct user research as well
               as go through existing dating apps to their understand their functions and audience.

    <div class="overview">
        <h2>Solution</h2>

        <div class="overview-text">
            <p>
                After exploring various dating apps such as Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge, I observed a recurring pattern: many users
                mentioned having a pet in their profiles. It's widely recognized that pets can alleviate stress and anxiety.
                Inspired by this observation, I envisioned creating a dating app centered around users' pets. This concept would
                provide a shared interest among users and encourage them to incorporate their furry companions into their dates.

                    For my user research I conducted 2 interviews asking them a series of 10 questions on their experience using dating
                    apps. After collecting the answers from both users, I concluded that they both did not like Tinder because of the
                    negative views surrounding the app. They both prefered Hinge and Bumble over Tinder finding it cooler due to its
                    personalized questions and unique features. Safety concerns arise due to the casual nature of interactions on these
                    apps, with most users not seeking anything serious. They both express a desire for an app where users can specify
                    their intentions and preferences more clearly. Overall, they appreciate apps that are welcoming, light, and fun,
                    with personalized elements that make interactions feel more human.
