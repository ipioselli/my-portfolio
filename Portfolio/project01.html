        <p class="bold">What is your carbon footprint?</p>
        <p>
            The amount of greenhouse gasses released into the atmosphere caused by human activities. The greenhouse
            gasses trap heat in the atmosphere, which accelerates the heating of the globe. I wanted to explore the
            environmental impact of our carbon footprint on climate change and how we can offset our individual carbon
            footprint. I wanted to raise awareness on this topic through an app prototype that uses gamification elements
            to enhance user engagement.

    <h2>Problem Space</h2>

    <div class="overview-text">
        <p class="bold">How can gamification and the use of “living” animals be used to engage user’s to take positive actions towards
            climate change and experience their carbon footprint?</p>
        <p>
            Climate change and carbon footprint can be challenging topics to digest. I aimed to explore alternative methods
            to engage users in this subject. Many applications leverage gamification features to encourage users to remain
            engaged, as seen in DuoLingo. I sought to delve deeper into the intersection of gamification features, user
            engagement, and climate change in my research.

    <div class="overview">
        <h2>Goal</h2>
    
        <div class="overview-text">
            <p>
                My goal for this project was to create an intuitive design that meets the needs of the users and the target audience
                by taking my research into account.
                I want to include gamification features to increase user engagement and implement simple tasks for users to complete
                in order for them to be more conscious of their
                individual carbon footprint.

        <div class="overview-text">
            <p>
                My solution to this problem was to design an interactive app by conducting research on existing products and
                conducting user interviews. I also wanted to create an interactive prototype using gamification and tamagotchi game elements like in Duo Lingo and PokemonGo and see how user's react to
                climate change when they have the responsibility of taking care of a "living" creature

            <p>
                For my research I looked at existing successful gamified apps such as Duo Lingo and Pokemon Go and decided I would
                center my research creation around that. Through academic research, I discovered that having a virtual
                pet/Tamagotchi creates an emotional attachment between the user and objects. User's are also more likely to keep
                using an app if they know that a life is in their responsibility. Gamification adds a motivational and competitive
                element, gives the user control and a feeling of achievement.
                I conduced user testing interviews after the prototype was done to receive
                feedback.
