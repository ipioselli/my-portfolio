                My final website is a parody of existing fast fashion websites. I wanted to explore fast fashion and the effects it
                has on our society as well as its environmental impact. Marketing on social media has negatively impacted fashion
                trends. The trends are constantly changing which causes over consumption and brands create over produced poor
                quality clothing. As a consequence of this, there is a negative impact on pollution as well as cheap labour.
                For my final website I took inspirations from fast fashion website such as H&M, Garage, Fashion Nova and Pretty
                little thing. The name of my brand is Style City. On the website there are 7 active pages that you can navigate to
                including the home page. On the surface the website looks like a regular fashion website however, after clicking
                some buttons you can find hidden sections that go more into detail about the impact the fast fashion industry has on
                our planet and society.

        <h2>Problem Space</h2>

        <div class="overview-text">
            <p class="bold">How might we help users be aware of the negative affects of fast fashion and consumerism in a interactive way?</p>
            <p>
                Social media is negatively impacting fashion trends which in turn is causing consumers to buy more than they need. Consequently, this is negatively impacting our planet. It is impacting pollution, imposing health hazards on workers, and continues to use child labour. It is important to be aware of what we are buying.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="overview">
        <h2>Goal</h2>

        <div class="overview-text">
            <p>
                My goal was to design and create an interactive parody clothing website to bring awareness to the issue. I
                wanted to showcase information on consumer and fast fashion in an easy and digestible way. I used CSS, HTML and
                JavaScript to create the final website. On the surface each page looks like a regular page from a clothing
                website however, after looking deeper there is hidden information on each page.
                </p>

    </div>

    <div class="overview">
        <h2>Solution</h2>

        <div class="overview-text">
            <p>
                In order to do this I needed to create a research paper to understand consumerism and why consumers
                are so drawn to these websites. With the research I would be able to implement key functions from these fashion websites into 
                my own parody website to mimick their style in order to attract consumers. I also wanted to add hidden elements and text when clicking
                on certain buttons so it is not too obvious in order to inform consumers on their purchases without boring them
                with too much text.

                    I conducted my research by reading through different academic papers on fast fashion and the consequences it has on
                    our environment. I also looked through many different fast fashion websites such as Garage, Shein and Fashionnova
                    and tried to understand the appeal of the UI and user experience. I discovered that there was a lot going on on each
                    website. There was a lot of elements with bright and flashy colours. Keeping this in mind I decided to replicate
                    this look onto my website to create a parody of these websites and include hidden information throughout the
                    website.
