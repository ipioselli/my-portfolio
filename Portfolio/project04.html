            <p>
            
                My final website is a parody of existing fast fashion websites. I wanted to explore fast fashion and the effects it
                has on our society as well as its environmental impact. Marketing on social media has negatively impacted fashion
                trends. The trends are constantly changing which causes over consumption and brands create over produced poor
                quality clothing. As a consequence of this, there is a negative impact on pollution as well as cheap labour.
                For my final website I took inspirations from fast fashion website such as H&M, Garage, Fashion Nova and Pretty
                little thing. The name of my brand is Style City. On the website there are 7 active pages that you can navigate to
                including the home page. On the surface the website looks like a regular fashion website however, after clicking
                some buttons you can find hidden sections that go more into detail about the impact the fast fashion industry has on
                our planet and society.

        <div class="overview-text">
            <p class="bold">How might we help students find the best locations for studying and doing their homework
                while also getting the opportunity to meet other students?</p>
            <p>
                Students can find it difficult to concentrate in crowded and places with a lot of distractions. It can
                also be difficult to find seating in cafes and libraries during midterm and finals season. How might we
                help students find the best environment for concentrating/studying?
                I also wanted to know how I could help students meet with other students in similar programs. After the
                pandemic, many students missed a lot of the university/college experience and were not able to meet
                people in their classes. Making friends is also an issue a lot of students face.

        <h2>Goal</h2>

        <div class="overview-text">
            <p>
                My goal was to design an app prototype called Study Spaces that would help them find a place to study
                and work
                such as a cafe or library. This app would allow them to create a profile and make friends in similar
                programs
                and classes.

        <h2>Solution</h2>

        <div class="overview-text">
            <p>
                In order to do this I needed to conduct user research to understand and empathize with my target
                audience. From my research I would then
                create my wireframes and prototype to envision a user interface and experience to reflect the user's
                needs.

                For my user research I conducted a survey on 7 university students and 1 short interview to follow up
                from the
                survey. I asked them questions to get to know how they study, where they study and how they feel about
                studying with
                other people.

            <h2>Empathy Map</h2>
            <p>After analyzing my research materials I found that the common user is the studious student that takes school seriously but can also be stressed and overwhelmed. I made an empathy map to represent this type of user and to understand what they want in a prototype. I put down what the student says, thinks, does and feels based on the answers from my survey.</p>

    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <div class="research-text">
        <p>
            From the user interviews I understood that many users want to meet new people and study in different locations other than their home since it can often be distracting if you are living with other people. However, it is important for them to find spaces with not a lot of distractions and minimal noise.

                The main concept of this app is to help students find study locations near them and to meet other students in similar fields.
                <p class="bold">I wanted to include:</p>
                <li>Filters to find the best possible location</li>
                <li>A home page with all favourites locations</li>
                <li>Have a live forum so that people can know if the location is currently busy</li>

            <p class="bold">Why:</p>
            <li>To meet friends and new people</li>
            <li>Hard to find good study spots that are not too crowded, small, have slow wifi, etc.</li>
